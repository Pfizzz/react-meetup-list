# Meet-up List

This is an app I made by following along with an epic tutorial by Max from Acade Mind at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk

It uses React and connects to a personal Firebase server to store data for a "meet-up" application. Unfortunately, the project does not implement local storage for data persistence, but this was my attempt to get more comfortable with React's way of doing things.
